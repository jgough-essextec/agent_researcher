Based on our conversation, here is the detailed **Product Backlog** for your Agentic Prospecting Application.

---

# **Project Name: The Deep Prospecting Engine**

**Goal:** A local, agentic application that leverages Gemini Deep Research to identify high-value AI/ML sales opportunities for specific clients, utilizing "silent" historical memory to improve recommendations over time.

## **Epic 1: Core Infrastructure & Data Ingestion**

**Objective:** Establish the local environment, user interface, and connection to external AI services.

* **Story 1.1 (Setup):** As a developer, I want to initialize a local Python environment with **LangGraph** as the orchestration framework to manage stateful agent workflows.
* **Story 1.2 (UI Input):** As a user, I want a lightweight local UI (e.g., Streamlit or Chainlit) where I can input a "Client Name" and a text block for "Past Sales History."
* **Story 1.3 (API Integration):** As a developer, I want to securely manage API keys for Gemini Deep Research (and other models) so that the application can authenticate without hardcoding credentials.
* **Story 1.4 (Prompt Configuration):** As a user, I want the ability to view and edit the "Base Research Prompt" in the UI before execution, allowing me to steer the research toward specific areas (e.g., "Focus on their supply chain") if needed.

## **Epic 2: The Deep Research & Competitive Analysis**

**Objective:** Gather deep, factual intelligence on the client and their vertical.

* **Story 2.1 (Deep Research Execution):** As the system, I want to send the "Client Name" and "Base Prompt" to the Gemini Deep Research API to generate a comprehensive report on the client's current digital maturity, AI footprint, and strategic goals.
* **Story 2.2 (Vertical Identification):** As an agent, I want to parse the research report to explicitly classify the client's "Vertical" and "Domain" for downstream categorization.
* **Story 2.3 (Competitor Scout):** As an agent, I want to search for *competitors* in the identified vertical who have published AI case studies, creating a list of "Proof Points" to use as leverage (FOMO).
* **Story 2.4 (History Synthesis):** As an agent, I want to analyze the provided "Past Sales History" to identify technical gaps—e.g., "They bought Cloud storage, but no compute; they likely need an ML modernization play."

## **Epic 3: The "Silent Memory" (Vector Knowledge Base)**

**Objective:** Enable the system to learn from past wins without rigidly constraining new research.

* **Story 3.1 (Vector DB Implementation):** As a developer, I want to implement a local instance of **ChromaDB** to store client profiles and successful sales plays.
* **Story 3.2 (Context Retrieval):** As the system, *before* ideation begins, I want to query the Vector DB for "Similar Clients" (based on vertical/size) and retrieve their successful "Sales Plays" to inject into the agent's context window.
* **Story 3.3 (Memory Injection):** As the "id8" agent, I want to see a section in my prompt titled "Historical Successes in this Vertical" so I can prioritize proven strategies while still exploring new ones.
* **Story 3.4 (Knowledge Capture):** As the system, upon completion of a run, I want to automatically embed and save the newly generated "Sales Plays" back into ChromaDB for future use.

## **Epic 4: The Ideation Loop ("id8")**

**Objective:** Generate a high volume of ideas, then refine them into high-quality sales plays.

* **Story 4.1 (Divergent Ideation):** As the "id8" agent, I want to generate a raw list of 10+ potential AI use cases by crossing the "Deep Research" findings with the "Competitor Proof Points" and "Past Sales History."
* **Story 4.2 (Convergent Refinement):** As the "id8" agent, I want to critique my own list, filtering out ideas that are technically unfeasible or too low-value, narrowing the list down to the top 3 strongest "Sales Plays."
* **Story 4.3 (Technical Feasibility Check):** As an agent, I want to briefly validate that the proposed solution aligns with modern tech stacks (e.g., ensuring we aren't proposing deprecated tech) before finalizing the list.

## **Epic 5: Asset Generation & Voice**

**Objective:** Transform raw ideas into polished, client-ready assets in the specific "Pellera" voice.

* **Story 5.1 (Voice Personality):** As a developer, I want to configure a "System Prompt" that enforces the Pellera Chief Scientist persona—authoritative, insightful, and focused on value-added reselling—for all written output.
* **Story 5.2 (One-Pager Generation):** As a user, I want a Markdown file for each of the top 3 plays that follows the structure: *The Challenge -> The Market Standard (Competitors) -> The Pellera Solution -> The Business Outcome*.
* **Story 5.3 (Business Plan Generation):** As a user, I want a consolidated "Strategic Account Plan" (Markdown) that summarizes the client's state, our history, and the roadmap for the proposed AI initiatives.
* **Story 5.4 (Source Citing):** As a user, I want all assertions in the documents (e.g., "Competitor X is doing Y") to include footnotes or links to the sources found during the Deep Research phase.
