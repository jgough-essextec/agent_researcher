Answer each of these questions:

1. How many open positions does {client_name} currently have listed? Search LinkedIn Jobs, Indeed, Glassdoor, and {website}/careers.
2. Which departments have the most openings? Break down by: Engineering/IT, Sales, Marketing, Operations, Finance, HR, and other.
3. What specific technologies, certifications, and skills appear in technical job postings? List the most frequently mentioned: programming languages, cloud platforms, security tools, data platforms, and AI/ML frameworks.
4. What seniority levels are being hired? Estimate distribution across: Entry, Mid, Senior, Director/VP, and Executive.
5. Are there urgency signals? Look for: sign-on bonuses, "immediate start," relocation packages, "newly created role," or multiple postings for the same role title.
6. What do the hiring patterns reveal about company priorities? Heavy engineering hiring suggests product investment. Security hiring suggests compliance pressure. Data hiring suggests analytics investment. Sales hiring suggests growth mode.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
HIRING VOLUME: Total openings and trend vs. 3-6 months ago if available
DEPARTMENT BREAKDOWN: Department | Approximate count | Notable roles
TECHNOLOGY SIGNALS: Most frequently mentioned technologies across postings
SENIORITY MIX: Distribution across levels
URGENCY SIGNALS: Specific indicators with examples
STRATEGIC INTERPRETATION: 2-3 sentences on what hiring patterns reveal'''

Answer each of these questions:

1. What is {client_name}'s overall Glassdoor rating (out of 5.0)? What are the sub-ratings for: Work-Life Balance, Compensation & Benefits, Culture & Values, Senior Leadership, Career Opportunities?
2. What percentage of employees recommend {client_name} to a friend? What percentage approve of the CEO?
3. What are the most common POSITIVE themes in recent reviews (last 12 months)? Quote specific patterns, not generic praise.
4. What are the most common NEGATIVE themes in recent reviews (last 12 months)? Look for: management issues, technical debt frustration, tooling complaints, process inefficiencies, or organizational dysfunction that might indicate technology pain points.
5. Is overall sentiment improving, declining, or stable compared to 12-24 months ago?
6. Are there specific reviews from IT, Engineering, or Technology teams that reveal internal technology frustrations or positive signals about tools and processes?

OUTPUT FORMAT:
RATINGS: Overall | Work-Life | Comp | Culture | Leadership | Career Opportunities | Recommend % | CEO Approval %
POSITIVE THEMES: Top 3-5 with representative examples
NEGATIVE THEMES: Top 3-5 with representative examples (flag technology/process-related complaints)

1. What is {client_name}'s LinkedIn company page follower count? What is the approximate employee count on LinkedIn? Is headcount growing, shrinking, or flat versus 6 months ago?
2. What has {client_name} posted on LinkedIn recently? Summarize the last 3-5 company posts — are they focused on hiring, product announcements, thought leadership, culture marketing, or awards?
3. Are there notable Reddit threads (r/sysadmin, r/ITCareerQuestions, r/cscareerquestions, or industry-specific subreddits) discussing {client_name} as an employer, customer, or technology partner?
4. What is the general sentiment on Twitter/X about {client_name}? Search for recent mentions related to products, customer experience, or employer reputation.
5. Has {client_name} received any employer brand recognition: Great Place to Work, Fortune Best Companies, Comparably awards, or similar?

SCOPE: Do NOT cover financial news, executive changes, or business strategy — those are handled in a separate research track. Focus on social signals, employer brand, and culture indicators.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
LINKEDIN PRESENCE: Followers | Employee count | Headcount trend | Recent post themes
SOCIAL SENTIMENT: Platform | Topic | Sentiment (positive/negative/mixed) | Summary
EMPLOYER BRAND: Awards, recognition, notable culture signals
SALES-RELEVANT SIGNALS: Social signals indicating buying readiness, organizational change, or technology frustration'''
